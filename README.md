# Interactive JavaScript

This repository features a fun interactive JavaScript project where the "No" button on a webpage moves randomly when hovered over. This playful behavior is achieved by using the `Math.random()` function to reposition the element each time the cursor moves over it.

## Features
- **Interactive Element**: The "No" button moves to a random location on the page when hovered over.
- **JavaScript Fun**: Uses JavaScript for real-time DOM manipulation with the `Math.random()` function to change the button's position.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nerdylelouch/interactive-javascript.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the effect.

## Usage
Simply move your cursor to the "No" button and watch it evade the mouse by jumping to a new random position.

## Customization
You can modify the behavior by adjusting the CSS styles or the JavaScript logic in `script.js` to suit your needs.

## Cheeky Use Case
You can definitely use this as a fun way to apologise to your significant other, crush, or anyone youâ€™ve got some explaining to do with. Just have the button "move away" as you try to get them to say "Yes"! It's a playful way to lighten the mood and add a bit of humor to your day.
